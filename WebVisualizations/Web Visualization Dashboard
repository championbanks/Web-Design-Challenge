				<h1>Web Visualization Dashboard </h1>
				<p>This websit enables the visualization the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. 
				It is utilizing a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), 
				the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and a little common sense to create a representative
				model of weather across world cities.

                The objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

				* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
				* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
				* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
				* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude</p>
